Well\ntested, with over 150 assertions and 100% code coverage!\n\nTested with Underscore & Lo-Dash, Backbone and jQuery. You can swap out jQuery\nwith a custom configuration or substitute Underscore with Lo-Dash.\n\n## Documentation ##\n\nRefer to: http://tbranyen.github.com/backbone.layoutmanager/\n\nMigration guide: https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/pull/184\n\n## Release notes ##\n\n* Updated lookup for `serialize` and `data` to also look on the instance so\n  that `configure` doesn't always override.\n\n[Full Release Log](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/blob/master/changelog.md)\n\n## Donate ##\n\nI do my very best to ensure top quality and continued progress with\nLayoutManager.  Developers using, but not contributing, may want to consider\nleaving a small donation to show their appreciation.\n\nAll funds collected will find their way to the [mspca](http://www.mspca.org/) organization.
