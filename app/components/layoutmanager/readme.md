Backbone.LayoutManager
======================

**v0.7.5** [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager)

Created by Tim Branyen [@tbranyen](http://twitter.com/tbranyen), with help
from [awesome contributors](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/contributors)

Provides a logical structure for assembling layouts with Backbone Views.
Designed to be adaptive and configurable for painless integration.  Well
tested, with over 150 assertions and 100% code coverage!

Tested with Underscore & Lo-Dash, Backbone and jQuery. You can swap out jQuery
with a custom configuration or substitute Underscore with Lo-Dash.

Migration guide: https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/pull/184

## Release notes ##

* Updated lookup for `serialize` and `data` to also look on the instance so
  that `configure` doesn't always override.
